## Future Areas of Study

- typedefs - Defining your own custom data types in C
- Using the Preprocessor to do more stuff like string concatenation
- void\*'s
- static libraries and shared objects.
  - How to create libraries and import 3rd party C libraries.
  - Shared Objects??? \*.so files. They are not compile time. Pull in binaries?
- Macros
- Unions
- Function Pointers. You can have pointers that point to functions
- Advanced Pointers. Pointers to pointers.
- Variadic functions
- Dynamic linking (dlm_open)
- Signals, forking, and inter-process communication.
  - IPPC via files, sockets, UNIX pipes
- Threading and Concurrency
- Sockets (used for networking)
- setjmp and longjmp for restoring state
- memory management and fragmentation
- Making C programs more portable (POSIX)
- Interface with kernel modules (drivers and ioctls)
- Compiler and linker flags
- Advanced use of gdb - GNU Debugger
- Profiling and tracing tools (gprof, dtrace, strace)
- memory debugging tools like valgrind
- Variadic Functions

## Questions

- How do I pull in 3rd party libraries in the C ecosystem? How do I find them?
- What do I need to do to break my project up into separate files and headers?
- What is the pattern for creating a 3rd party library for others?
- What libraries help ensure cross-platform compatibility?

## Future Projects

- Compile a WebAssembly Module and Integrate into a sample app using the native module loader
